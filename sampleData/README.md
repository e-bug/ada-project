# Sample Data

This directory contains samples of each weather parameter we have collected from Idaweb. <br>
The three parameters are:
- Mean Irradiance: average over 10 minutes of the global radiation in each station [W/m<sup>2</sup>]
- Temperature: air temperature at 2 meters above ground for each station, measured every 10 minutes [Â°C]
- Variance Irradiance: standard deviation of global radiation over 10 minutes in each station [W/m<sup>2</sup>]

<br>
These parameters are used as the primary features of a regression model to estimate the solar potential at a specific location. 
Further details are available in the [learning module](https://github.com/e-bug/solarity/tree/master/learning).
